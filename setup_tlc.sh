# This script will download the TLA+ tools to the current directory.
# After downloading it will also add the tools directory to your CLASSPATH
# environment so that you can run the tools from the command line. If you want
# the directory in your CLASSPATH permanently, you will have to add it to your
# shell startup script i.e. .bashrc, .zshrc, etc.
#
# Usage:
#
#	source setup_tlc.sh
#
